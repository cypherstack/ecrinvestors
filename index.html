        <h2>What is EPICENTER?</h2>
        <p>Epicenter is a community-driven, privacy-preserving ecosystem composed of independent interoperable “money legos” that work seamlessly with each other to bring down barriers to entry and friction that prevent universal access and adoption. They also interconnect with other blockchains.</p>
        <p>Our starting point was $EPIC, the native currency of the EPIC Blockchain Protocol, and the key component to make it all work. Epic Private Internet Cash - “Epic Cash” or simply “EPIC” is what Bitcoin would be if Satoshi were developing it in 2019 based on available tech at that time plus the experience gained from the 1000s of altcoin experiments till date.</p>
        <p>Epic is a lightweight, scalable, privacy-enabled mobile-native blockchain that is faster, more agile, more flexible, future-proofed and extensible than today’s ossified, frozen in 2008 BTC with its prevailing ‘HODL’ ideology and aversion to base layer innovation.</p>

   <div class="row center-row">
    <div class="col text-only">
        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>We are a lean and capable team consisting of <a href="http://wayangarvey.com" target="_blank">successful entrepreneurs</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/genelurye" target="_blank">tech industry veterans</a>, <a href="https://www.cypherstack.com/about.html" target="_blank">crypto pioneers</a>, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/spencerlambert" target="_blank">fintech experts</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/todd-lewis" target="_blank">distributed systems and formal methods engineers</a> as well as approximately 200 volunteer <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S4s6Kbuz8bUvvQRa8TbyAvP0h90OVH48/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">community contributors</a> in dozens of countries worldwide. We have depth and breadth in business development, marketing, and especially technology. We have directly participated in dozens of open source projects, bringing decades of cumulative experience in a range of disciplines.</p>
        <p>Since fair-launching the protocol in September 2019 with no ICO, no premine, and no VC involvement, we have grown the project from zero market cap to over 40 million USD, using a grassroots approach – without paid advertising, paid exchanges, paid anything. We did this to match the path of Bitcoin and to pass the Howey test to not be considered a security (we have an ironclad <a href="http://epicenter.epic.tech/investors" target="_blank">legal opinion letter</a> to this effect). This allows us to create additional derivative layers of value on top of our layer one EPIC Blockchain Protocol. These additional layers include <a href="http://ecr.epic.tech" target="_blank">ECR</a>, a DAO equity/governance token, <a href="http://eusd.epic.tech" target="_blank">EUSD</a>, a tending-towards-stable crypto dollar, and <a href="http://ecap.epic.tech" target="_blank">ECAP</a>, an autonomous  hyperdeflationary passive compounding vehicle.</p>
        <p>As we continue to build out the ecosystem around the core protocols and add functionality, there will be considerable revenue enhancing opportunities for investment and growth into a broad range of <a href="http://epicentral.io" target="_blank">demographics</a>.</p>
        <p>Over the next series of quarters we will roll out <a href="http://epicenter.epic.tech/roadmap" target="_blank">6-8 additional components</a> connected to the Epic ecosystem, each a force multiplier that immediately accretes incremental wins to set up flywheels that turbocharge value aggregation onto the chains and drive positive results for investors.</p>
        <p>Similar to Apple and Amazon – Epicenter is not a single product, rather a growing value generating platform. Currently our community spans 100+ countries and is growing every day. Because we have deliberately eschewed paid marketing, we are virtually unknown and it is still very early days in our story.</p>
        <p>Presently we see cryptocurrency becoming an institutionalized commodity, with 221 million people holding some in one form or another and >50% of global macro funds finally entering the asset class. Over the years, successful Bitcoin “maxis” have used the pitch recommending that investors divert 1-2% of their net worth away from traditional store of value assets such as gold. Their premise was that Bitcoin was much more likely to 2x than gold and they have so far been proven right. In today’s landscape, we believe that investing 1-2% away from BTC and 1-2% away from gold gives investors vastly better odds of 2-5x as well as providing a source of uncorrelated performance.</p>
        <p>Our value proposition is similar – we know the odds of $EPIC outperforming BTC are apparent – especially considering where we are today, our solid tech and tokenomics (scarcity, fungibility, accessibility, privacy and scalability). Unlike BTC, $EPIC represents a truly unconfiscatable form of private property that cannot be tainted or traced. Because of our energy efficient proof of work approach, with a blockchain that is vastly more compact than BTC, we are targeting the 2 billion user PC gaming market, and starting next year the 7+ billion user smartphone market. This will give us a critical mass of user growth and use cases and allow us to achieve true broad scale adoption that has eluded BTC to date. We see payments, particularly physical point of sale, and cash/medium of exchange use cases as particularly low-hanging fruit.</p>

        <h2>Onboarding External Capital</h2>
        <p>We are aggressively seeking investment from a small group of savvy partners who understand our value proposition, to increase the growth multiplier and to reduce the timeline. While we believe that we can accomplish our goals without outside investment, we understand that if we have more money at this juncture to invest into infrastructure, marketing and business development, we will be able to multiply our gains dramatically. This is especially evident in today’s geopolitical, social and economic climate – we are presented with a unique window of opportunity and we are looking for partners with vision to fulfill our potential.</p>

        <p>We consider it to be Bitcoin Perfected, how Satoshi would obviously have done it had he started in 2019 instead of 2008. It is the Bitcoin monetary emission standard of 21 million coins in the year 2140. Using full Nakamoto Consensus and 100% proof of work, its crucially important original game theory is preserved intact. In fact, it is strengthened, closer to “1 cpu-1 vote” thanks to its multi-algorithm nature. Right now we have 5k+ mining nodes in 101 countries, 48% CPU on RandomX and 48% GPU on ProgPow, 4% to ASIC.</p>

            <p>The Achilles’ heel of BTC is its lack of fungibility. No fungibility means it has the ineradicable problem of “tainted coins” and a differential market for freshly mined coins and those that have circulated. It burdens everyone with costs, adds friction and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/individual-arrested-and-charged-operating-notorious-darknet-cryptocurrency-mixer" target="_blank">risks</a>, and presents an attack surface / control vector for governments to apply AML regulation. El Salvador is a great example - those who cannot pass KYC are frozen out of the system and marginalized. BTC officially has no answer for the 1.7 billion as yet unbanked people, most of whom lack suitable identity documentation yet own cell phones.</p>

        <p>$EPIC can be thought of as <a href="https://bitcoin" target="_blank">https://bitcoin</a>, because everything is confidential to external parties by default - no addresses and no amounts are publicly revealed. Because every transaction in a block is one giant CoinJoin, it is impossible to unscramble the egg ex post facto. A variety of granular opt-in transparency features are available to facilitate regulatory compliance.</p>
        <p>A form of blockchain compression known as <a href="https://encyclopediafreemania.com/en/Glossary" target="_blank">Mimblewimble</a> nets out offsetting transactions, so it’s also very light, fast, and lean - perfect for mobile devices - <a href="http://epicenter.epic.tech/scalability" target="_blank"><2gb at present vs 355gb</a> for BTC. Even at BTC-level usage, it will still only be 25-50gb. The entire network fits in a pocket and runs locally, even on a low-end mobile device.</p>
        <img src="/img/epic-chain-file.png" alt="EPIC Chain File and Offsetting Transactions">
        <p>Will governments and 3 letter agencies have a problem with this tech? No, it is a “goldilocks level” that precludes frontrunning and AI-driven social credit style transaction filtering, it is unsuited to facilitate crime. The crude, overkill approaches to privacy pursued by earlier networks provoke an immune response and arouse the ire of powers that be. Our key settings are very carefully chosen.</p>
        <div class="col-2">
            <p>Though cryptocurrency adoption has made great strides, volatility is still a major unsolved problem, and two facts point to the central relevance of stablecoins as key infrastructure for not just BTC but the entire space: 1) 90+% of trading activity is in the BTC/USDT pair and 2) Growth from $2b to $100+b in 3 years of the stablecoin market cap.</p><img src="/img/freeman-coin.png">
        </div>
        <p>EPIC has original Bitcoin Number Go Up ™ Technology, designed to drive price to infinity through disinflationary halvings just like its earlier BTC forebear. However, this powerful and very desirable feature is actually a bug for people who would want to denominate their affairs (imagine a long term contract) in this currency - someone is going to get a bad deal.</p>

        <h2>EUSD</h2>
        <p>Clearly, what is needed is a type of asset that will tend toward $1 in value, but not have any connection at all to anything that any government can attack, seeing as how even mighty <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-subpoenas-usdc-stablecoin-issuer-circle/" target="_blank">USDC just got a SEC subpoena</a>. For this, we creatively reference $EPIC in a pre-1971 dollar-inspired tending-towards-stable floor-pegged cryptodollar design known as EUSD.  Censorship resistance is paramount, and regulatory compatibility is a central reason for that.</p>
        <p>$EPIC plays the role of gold in our Exter’s Pyramid, as it is the exclusive collateral underpinning the EUSD cryptodollar token. EUSD is, like the pre-1971, Federal Reserve Note, redeemable on demand for real money - in the case of the Federal Reserve Note, 1/35th oz of physical gold (only open to central banks, and only if the government allowed it, of course).</p>
        <p>With EUSD, it’s $1 worth of $EPIC zapped directly to the user’s wallet via anonymous smart contract where 24/7, anyone, anytime, and nobody can ever be denied service. This cryptodollar is, like its namesake the Eurodollar, a dollar that exists outside the scope of the traditional system.</p>
        <p>Anyone, anywhere can create EUSD by interacting with a smart contract on one of 30+ different free open source blockchains (Ethereum and its competition). The minting is controlled by an algorithmic central bank represented by ECR tokenholders and they must own $EPIC to do so. It is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_eIGew_snIn5s09z4TdoQmZ1EwMH09AiQRETaReOULA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">fully-reserved, autonomous, infinite, decentralized self-banking system</a>.</p>
        <p>For $EPIC holders, EUSD on-demand liquidity represents a convenient and low-cost source of capital with a range of available equity-based lines of credit available.</p>

            <p>The vision for what is now Epicenter DAO began to form in mid-2018. We identified interest-bearing currency as a major source of capital misallocation and negative externalities in the global economy and sought to develop an alternative.</p>
            <img src="/img/epicenter-dao.png">
        </div>
        <p>Existing as pure software, <a href="http://epicenter.epic.tech" target="_blank">Epicenter DAO</a> (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is entirely decentralized. We have no physical presence: no corporation, no office, no board of directors, no lawyers. No executives, no employees, no VC stakeholders, no lobbyists.</p>
        <p>We ideated, built, bootstrapped and socialized a novel and genuinely useful Layer 1 with only sweat equity and our own internal resources. Now, we seek to commercialize and monetize it by onboarding external capital. We are looking to bring people into our fold who bring key relationships, pursue advocacy, and allow us to compress time and accelerate our progress through their presence and active contribution.</p>
        <p>With hot button issues on everyone’s mind such as <a href="https://deep-resonance.org/2021/07/24/uniswap-introduces-token-censorship-on-its-front-end-due-to-regulatory-reasons-protocol-remains-decentralized-as-ever/" target="_blank">Uniswap’s proactive censorship</a> of certain assets, <a href="https://decrypt.co/82387/defi-community-blasts-compound-ceo-for-doxxed-comment" target="_blank">Compound’s doxxing and threatening its users</a>, we believe that our independence and autonomy will enable us to remain <a href="https://maxfreeman4.substack.com/p/epicenter-core-values" target="_blank">pure</a> and avoid external capture. That creates an extra degree of censorship resistance and regulatory compatibility that more centralized projects can't match. Our communications have no need for lawyerly disclaimers about securities because our protocols register sub-zero on the CRC scorecard scale, which means that we’ve eradicated the type of risks that <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=maker+dao+lawsuit&t=brave&ia=web" target="_blank">Maker DAO faced through its Dutch foundation in California</a>.</p>
        <p>In this design, the seigniorage benefits accrue to us, the user-owner-operator-creators of ECR - Every Citizen’s Reserve, and our sovereign wealth fund - ECAP - Epicenter Capital Accumulation Protocol, rather than a privately-owned government-enforced currency cartel.</p>
        <p>Ours is a proven successful formula, following <span class="bold">ETH/MKR/DAI</span> in the footsteps of the holy Trinity of Ethereum DeFi, to which our answer is <span class="bold">EPIC/ECR/EUSD</span>. Coming 5 years later with a focus on enhanced <a href="http://epicenter.epic.tech/censorship-resistance" target="_blank">censorship resistance</a>, each component is improved individually, and they work better together. We’ve integrated the lessons learned from the entire 10,000+ digital asset landscape, fortunate to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
